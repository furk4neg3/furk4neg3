## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Computer Engineering student at **Gazi University** (GPA: **3.91/4.00**) with deep interest and hands-on experience in **AI, data science, federated learning**, and **system-level engineering**. I’ve led impactful projects across **aerospace, transportation, and SaaS AI**, delivering measurable results through scalable, intelligent solutions.

Currently, I’m a **Data Science Intern at Jotform**, building tools to preview and evaluate AI agent behavior in real-time. My focus is on **AI-driven workflows, protocol design**, and bridging the gap between model development and production deployment.
